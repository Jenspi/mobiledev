## Preqeqs

* <b>Git</b>
* <b>Node</b>
    1. Type the following into the terminal:
        ```
        curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.31.3/install.sh | bash
        ```
    2. Exit terminal and reopen.
    3. Type `nvm` and you will get a response if it worked.
    4. Install version 16: `nvm install 16`.
    5. Make your alias: `nvm alias default 16`.
    6. Verify that `node -v` returns the correct version.
* <b>NPM</b>
    1. Go to the directory the project is in and open a terminal window there.
    2. `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
    3. You will see a folder named `node_modules` in the directory once done.
    4. `npm start`

# Running the projects

#### With the terminal
Use `npm start` in the terminal and scan the QR code that shows up. You will need the Expo Go app, where this QR code will redirect to.

#### With Android Studio
Open project in [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) > add a device in the Device Manager > `npm start` in the Android Studio terminal > press "a" for Android.

# Common debugging

* <b>ReadableStream not defined:</b>
```
ReferenceError: ReadableStream is not defined
at Object.<anonymous> ...........
```
1. Update node to version 18 with the following:
    1. Install version 16: `nvm install 18`.
    2. Make your alias: `nvm alias default 18`.
    3. Verify that `node -v` returns the correct version.

* <b>Permission denied:</b>
```
> expo start

sh: ....../node_modules/.bin/expo: Permission denied
```
1. Delete the expo file by running the command `cd node_modules/.bin`, then `sudo rm -rf expo`. *(this will not disrupt anything)*
2. Reinstall npm in the project root, if necessary, with `npm install`.
