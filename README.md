# Project Descriptions
### [Main Code](https://github.com/Jenspi/mobiledev/tree/main/Main%20code)
→ Main page, listing (almost, if not all) every project all on one page. Aesthetics currently not the best, because I was consistently adding to it throughout the semester. This project lists concepts and which projects we made with these new concepts. Individual work.
### [Learning](https://github.com/Jenspi/mobiledev/tree/main/learning/Final%20Challenges/FlatList)
→ One challenge, learning to use flatlists (with a Pokémon theme). Individual work.
### [HW1](https://github.com/Jenspi/mobiledev/tree/main/HW1_HelloWorld)
→ Simple Hello World. Talked about my summer and went out of my way to make it scrollable, have color/font weight & styling, and have photos. Individual work.
### [HW2](https://github.com/Jenspi/mobiledev/tree/main/HW2_Combat)
→ [Unfinished] A turn-based mobile combat game. Could not get the monster to attack back and other small details. Individual work.
### [HW3](https://github.com/Jenspi/mobiledev/tree/main/HW3_CRUD_Adventures/CRUD)
→ A game closely modeled after our Blog project, which was worked on together in class. Following CRUD, you can **C**reate randomly generated heroes, **R**ead heroes listed in the rosters, **U**pdate by sending heroes to complete missions, and **D**elete heroes with bad rolls or that have died. Individual work.
### [Blog](https://github.com/Jenspi/mobiledev/tree/main/blog/Blog)
→ Following the professor, we created a blog app using CRUD. This app was before learning persistent data.
### [Food](https://github.com/Jenspi/mobiledev/tree/main/food)
→ Following the professor, we used the [Yelp! API](https://docs.developer.yelp.com/docs/fusion-intro) to create a Yelp! clone.
### [jsonserver](https://github.com/Jenspi/mobiledev/tree/main/jsonserver)
→ [Unfinished] Server for persistent data.
