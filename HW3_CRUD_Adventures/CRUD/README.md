HW3: CRUD Adventures / 4661 / November 2023
Jenny Spicer â€“ jmspicer@uno.edu

This is an assignment for Mobile App Development implementing a lot of what we've learned throughout the entire semester.
It was heavily based on the last app we made together in class (a Blog app), and unfortunately has the same file names..
Sorry for the confusion, but I would hate to change everything and then everything breaks!

What we've learned since HW2 and implemented in HW3 includes (but is not limited to): Context/Providers, Navigation with Paramters, and Advanced State Management.

* Extra Credit I went for:
Visual Appeal
Can't Spell CRUD Without a D...

* Color Palette Credit:
["Sweetie Magic: Merge Spell - Game Concept"](https://color.adobe.com/trends/Game-design)

* Known bugs/issues:
Could not figure out how to snap NavBar to the bottom of every screen... it works on the landing screen but not the others.
Could not figure out how to check if an existing hero has the name that is about to be assigned to a new hero.

* Anything to keep in mind while playing the game:
I'd love feedback on where I used the colors from the color palette if there are any issues! I only used the five colors given in the palette,
plus black and white very rarely, so I know some of it might not be super easy to read. I've been looking at these colors for hours on hours,
so they're pretty easy for me to read by now.
