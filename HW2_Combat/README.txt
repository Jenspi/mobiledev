HW2: Mobile Combat / 4661 / September 2023
Jenny Spicer – jmspicer@uno.edu

This is an [incomplete] assignment for Mobile App Development, which I plan to keep working on in my free time to fix bugs, complete code, and work on every bonus.
Due to poor time management, I'm nearly three weeks late and want to deliver something so I can put my mind at ease..
This is definitely not a normal occurrence for me, as I typically go all out for these classes.

*Any Bells and Whistles (or other enhancements) you went for:
Beautification, Level up and fight again

*Any known bugs you encountered (even if they are still in the game! It helps me to know what
to look for / play around!).
Couldn't figure out how to decrease magic at the same time as healing, combat log, or how to get the monster to attack back.

*Anything else you’d like me to keep in mind while playing your game:
My game is kind of broken/incomplete. Because I'm two weeks late going on three,
I just want to submit what I have so I can move past it/work on it for fun.
I'm sorry it's so late (an incomplete on top of that),
but I'm using it as a learning lesson for the next homework.
I think it's best for both of us for me to submit what I have now and move on.
